# Would you rather than Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based web app.

The "Would You Rather?" Project is a application where users are given questions and must choose one of them. Users will be able to create their own sets of questions, choose between them, and keep track of question popularity.
